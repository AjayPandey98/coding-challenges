# Random short coding challenges

A repository to store random, normally short code snippets that are not related to any project in particular, but may be useful as reference some time in the future. For example Stack Overflow answers or LeetCode problem solutions.

## LeetCode problems

Proposed solutions to some LeetCode problems. The first column links to the problem in LeetCode, the last one links to the solution in this repository.
