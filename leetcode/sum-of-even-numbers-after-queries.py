# The brute force solution would perform the operations and calculate
# the sum of evens at each step, without trying to save any of the
# computed values to avoid recalculating them.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*q) - We iterate over all the queries q and, for
# each, iterate over the entire nums array of n values.
# Space complexity: O(n) - If we don't consider the input or output
# arrays and avoid using a temporary array, instead mutating the input,
# we can improve it to O(1).
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

# Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results. Iterate over
# the queries and, for each query, perform O(1) operations.

# Time complexity: O(n+q) - We iterate once over the input array nums to
# calculate the sum of evens in O(n), then we iterate over the queries
# array in O(q) and, for each query, perform O(1) operations.
# Space complexity: O(1) - If we don't consider the input or output
# arrays, notice that we need to mutate the input array to obtain that
# complexity, if we wanted to avoid doing so, we would need to make a
# copy, like in the previous solution, and the complexity would be O(n).
