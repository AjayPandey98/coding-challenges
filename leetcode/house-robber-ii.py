# Very similar problem to LeetCode 198. House Robber, we only have to take into consideration the fact that the
# first and last houses are connected. That means that we have to choose one or the other. We can compute
# the best result if we take the first house, and leave the last one out, then the best if we leave the first
# house out, and take the first one, and select the best between them.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use a constant amount of memory.
#
# Runtime: 65 ms, faster than 14.31% of Python3 online submissions for House Robber II.
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 98.12% of Python3 online submissions for House Robber II.

# The memoized solution has a higher theoretical complexity but it performs better on the LeetCode tests.
# Locally it is slower than the DP solution, which makes more sense.
