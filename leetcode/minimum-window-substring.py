# Use a counter to get the count of the characters in t, then use a
# sliding window to start checking characters in s, we increase the
# window on the right checking the characters that we find until we
# run out of characters or find all the ones that we need. If we find
# all characters in t, we check if the current window is the smallest
# that we have seen so far and save its length, then start shrinking the
# window from the left until it no longer satisfies the condition, then
# start increasing from the right again.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We only visit each element once to add it to
# the count of elements seen and once to remove it. For each element,
# we check if we have a full match in O(1)
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary can grow to the size of the
# input.
