# Use a sub-function to explore each branch of the current tree
# recursively in pre-order. Pass the sub-function a min and max value
# that represent the currently acceptable boundaries. Check that the
# root node value is within boundaries and use the root node value to
# update the call for the left, and right, branches of the sub-tree.

# Time complexity: O(n) - The algorithm will visit each tree node of a
# valid tree, it will fail faster for invalid trees.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The size of the call stack will grow in size
# linearly with the size of the input.
