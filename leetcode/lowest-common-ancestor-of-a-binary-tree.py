# Explore the tree using DFS, for each branch, return the number of nodes found in that branch, then check the root.
# When we find 2 matches, p and q, return the root of the subtree we are currently exploring.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We may need to visit every node.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The recursive call stack grows linearly with the size of the tree.
#
# Runtime: 96 ms, faster than 66.38% of Python3 online submissions for Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree.
# Memory Usage: 26.3 MB, less than 30.85% of Python3 online submissions for Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree.
