import timeit
from typing import List


# To be able to partition into two equal subsets, we can compute the
# half-sum of the values and try to get an arrangement of elements that
# adds to that value. If we can manage to do that, we can partition into
# two equal subsets, because the remaining elements will also add to
# the half-sum. We can sort the array in reverse order and start
# iterating over the values. If we see any value bigger than target, we
# return false, otherwise we add this value to the number of possible
# sums we can make with the elements we have seen.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We visit each element and, for each we
# compute the sum of adding this value to all sums we have seen before.
# Space complexity: O(s) - We store a list in the range [0..target]
#
# Runtime: 580 ms, faster than 78.96%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 86.61%
