# call decodeString().

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element of the input once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We use a list that will grow in length depending on the input size and the number of
# repeated sequences in the input.

# adding it again as the reconstructed sequence for each nested loop. Since we know that the number of nested
# loops is < n/4, because declaring a loop needs 3 extra characters, the complexity cannot grow to n^2.
# Space complexity: O(n*k) - The stack will grow to the size of the output string.
