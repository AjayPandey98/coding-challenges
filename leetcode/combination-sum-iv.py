# The brute force approach splits each branch into n branches, with n
# being the input size len(nums) at each step. If at any point the
# result equals target, it adds one to the ways to calculate the result.
# If the sum of elements selected on the branch goes over the target, it
# stops working on that branch.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^t) - n is the number of values in the input and t
# is the target value because in the worst case it could be the height
# of the tree.
# Space complexity: O(n^t) - For the call stack, same as above.
#
# The brute force solution would probably fail with Time Limit Exceeded.
#
# We can easily convert this solution to a memoized solution caching
# the results, for example using functools.cache, though it would be
# possible to use a dictionary with target values as keys and number
# of results for that target value as values.
#
# Time complexity: O(t) - Since we are memoizing the result for each
# possible value that the current target could have, and the value can
# only be an integer, we will make at most t calls.
# Space complexity: O(t) - For the call stack, we will make at most t
# calls. If we used a dictionary, it would be a max of size t.

# Runtime: 47 ms, faster than 84.07%
# Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 7.44%

    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        # there are to combine the elements of nums to get a target.

            if t < 0:
                # We have gone over the target, this branch did not
                # lead to a result.
                return 0
            if t == 0:

# We can build the dynamic programming bottom-up if we iterate over each
# value current target (ct) from 1..target. For each value ct, we
# iterate over all nums where num <= ct, and assign
#
# dp[ct] += dp[ct - num]
#
# The ways to get to the current target ct are all the ways we have
# found previously, plus how many ways we had to get the target ct-num
# because we know we can add num to any of these ways to get ct.
#
# Time complexity: O(t*n) - We iterate t times on the outer loop and n
# times on the inner loop on the worst case. Sorting the input array and
# breaking out of the inner loop when num > ct speeds the process but
# does not change the overall complexity.
# Space complexity: O(t) - We store an array of t values. Another option
# is to keep a dictionary, on the best case its size would be smaller,
# but on the tests the solution that uses the array performs better.
#
# Using defaultdict(int):
# Runtime: 53 ms, faster than 72.51%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 80.97%

# Using a prefilled array of length target + 1:
# Runtime: 37 ms, faster than 97.54%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 48.19%
