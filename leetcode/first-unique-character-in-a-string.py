import timeit

# One pass to count character frequencies and one pass to find the
# first character that is unique in the string.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Two passes == O(2n) => O(n).
# Space complexity: O(1) - The counter has a max size of 26.
#
# Runtime: 160 ms, faster than 59.19%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 59.01%
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        # One pass to count the character frequencies.
        freq = Counter(s)
        # Second pass to return the index of the first character with
        # frequency == 1.
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if freq[c] == 1:
                return i
        # If no character had a frequency of 1, return -1
        return -1


# This solution runs faster because the work is being done by C code
# instead of a Python loop. If the code performing the work was both C
# or Python, it should be slower than the previous one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1) - For the set, max of 26 characters.
#
# Runtime: 70 ms, faster than 98.50%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 59.01%
