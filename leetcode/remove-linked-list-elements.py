# Start by eliminating the value from the list head by skipping the
# pointer to head.next, if after this step we still have a head, travel
# through the list nodes checking the value of the next node, if it
# matches the search value, delete that node updating the linked list
# pointers.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity; O(1) - We only keep pointers in memory.
#
# Runtime: 126 ms, faster than 54.5%
# Memory Usage: 17.8 MB, less than 38.78%

    def removeElements(
        self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int
    ) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Remove val from the head.
        while head:
            if head.val == val:
                dup = head
                head = head.next
                del dup
            else:
                break
        if not head:
            return None
        # Remove val from the middle/end.
        current = head
        while current.next:
            next = current.next
            # Skip the value or move the pointer.
            if next.val == val:
                current.next = next.next

            else:
                current = current.next
        return head


# Since the head could be null or it could contain the value we want to
# remove from the list, use a dummy node as the temporary head, then we
# can treat the head as any other node and iterate over the nodes
# removing duplicate values. Once done, we return dummy.next.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity; O(1) - We only keep pointers in memory.
