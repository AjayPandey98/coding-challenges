# Iterate over all elements of the input, for each element, generate all
# subsets that contain it and the ones that don't.
#
# Time complexity: O(n * 2^n) - For each element, we have two options,
# take it or not, when we take it, we copy the result set in O(n) to
# pass it to one of the branches.
# Space complexity: O(2^n) - The result list will have 2^n elements.

# Runtime: 43 ms, faster than 76.59%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 35.80%

# We can implement the same solution without recursion by iterating
# over the list and copying all the existing subsets adding the current
# item that we are visiting.
#
# Time complexity: O(n * 2^n) - For each element, we have two options,
# take it or not, when we take it, we copy all the existing subsets and
# add this element to them before adding them to the previous result.
# Space complexity: O(2^n) - The result list will have 2^n elements.

# Another approach is to generate all possible bitmasks of the same
# length as the number of elements in the input, then iterate over them
# using their bit values to determine which elements to add to the
# current subset. If a given bit i is 0, the subset does not contain the
# element i, if it is 1, it does.
#
# Time complexity: O(n * 2^n) - We iterate over all possible bitmasks of
# length n, for each we append a result to the result set, which is
# amortized O(1)
# Space complexity: O(2^n) - The result list will have 2^n elements.
