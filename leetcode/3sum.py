# We can sort the input to start. If we fix the left-most element i and
# use a two-pointer approach to increase or decrease the sum of three
# elements that contains i, we can find the sum of three elements that
# contains i and equals 0, if any, in O(n) time.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We iterate over every element of the input
# and search the 3sum that contains it in O(n).
# Space complexity: O(1) - If we don't consider the input or output.
#
# Runtime: 976 ms, faster than 76.71%
# Memory Usage: 17.3 MB, less than 91.68%
