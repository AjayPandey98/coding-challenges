# Create a hashmap that stores numbers that we have seen already as keys
# and their indices as values, then iterate over the numbers in the
# input, for each number, check if the set contains a number that we can
# add to this one to add up to the target, if found, return their indices,
# the description guarantees that each test case will have at most one
# solution.
#
# Time complexity; O(n) - We visit each element of the input once, for
# each, we check if another element is in the set at O(1) cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The set can grow to size n.
#
# Runtime: 104 ms, faster than 52.66%
# Memory Usage: 15.1 MB, less than 49.66%
