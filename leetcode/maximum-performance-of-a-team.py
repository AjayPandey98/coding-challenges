# Question hints:
#
# Keep track of the engineers by their efficiency in decreasing order.
# Starting from one engineer, to build a team, it suffices to bring K-1
# more engineers who have higher efficiencies as well as high speeds.
#
# Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a
# team with the maximum performance.
#
# The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds
# multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

# Sort the engineers on descending order of efficiency O(n*log(n)), then
# start iterating over the sorted engineers, keeping a heap of size k
# with the highest k or less speeds that we have seen up to this point.
# For each engineer that we see, calculate the result of adding this
# engineer to the team. We can do that comparing its speed to the top of
# the heap, if necessary, push and pop from it a smaller value and
# adjust the running sum as needed. We multiply the running sum by the
# current engineer's efficiency, which is guaranteed to be the smallest
# efficiency value seen so far, even though there may be other equal
# values that have been used already. This way, for each engineer seen,
# we can calculate the result of using it on the team in O(log(k)), then
# we compare this value to the best that we have seen so far and keep
# the best.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the array, there is also the
# extra complexity of iterating over the engineers computing the result
# of adding them to the team, but that cost O(n*log(k)) is superseded by
# the cost of sorting.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The sorting takes place in memory, there is
# also O(k) for the heap, but that is also superseded by the sorting
# iterator.
#
# Runtime: 406 ms, faster than 94.94%
# Memory Usage: 29.6 MB, less than 95.36%
