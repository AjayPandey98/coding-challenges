import timeit

# The brute force solution would iterate over the entire array and, for
# each element, it would check the rest of the elements checking how
# many of them are weaker. O(n^2)

# If we sort the characters in decreasing order of their attack property,
# and then iterate over the sorted input keeping track of the highest
# defense value that we have seen for each attack value, we can then
# iterate over the characters and compare them with the best defense
# value of each attack value higher than theirs. Any character that has
# a lower defense value will be a weak character.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The highest cost comes from sorting,
# then we can iterate the array in O(n).
# Space complexity: O(m) - Where m is the number of different attack
# values in the input.
#
# Runtime: 3805 ms, faster than 34.62%
# Memory Usage: 66.7 MB, less than 90.86%
