# Use a stack to push the asteroids into. When we see a new left bound
# asteroid, and the last asteroid in the stack is right-bound, we pop
# from the stack until either the asteroid in top of the stack is
# traveling left, and/or this one has been destroyed.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element and decide to either
# push it onto the stack as it is or remove either this element and/or
# another one from the result. The complexity is bounded to O(2*n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack could have every element on the
# input.
#
# Runtime: 172 ms, faster than 36.29%
# Memory Usage: 15.3 MB, less than 25.57%
