MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Let dp[i][j] be the number of strings of length i that ends with the
# j-th vowel, and we know that:
#
# Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
# Each vowel 'a' may only be followed by an 'e'.
# Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by an 'a' or an 'i'.
# Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'.
# Each vowel 'o' may only be followed by an 'i' or a 'u'.
# Each vowel 'u' may only be followed by an 'a'.
#
# That means that we can iterate over all the numbers smaller than n
# and, for each iteration, the number of vowel combinations that we
# can do for each vowel will be the sum of the possible combinations
# of the vowels that are allowed to go before it according to the rules.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We loop once for each value between 1..n
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant space.
#
# Runtime: 326 ms, faster than 75.50%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 68.69%
