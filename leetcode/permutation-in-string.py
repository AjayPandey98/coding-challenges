import timeit
from collections import defaultdict

# A very similar problem to LeetCode 438. Find All Anagrams in a String. We can use the same technique:
# Use a hashmap to keep track of characters that we need vs characters we have seen.
# Negative values denote characters in s1 that we haven't found in s2 yet, positive values denote characters that we
# have seen in s2 but aren't, or not in the same frequency, in s1. When we have the same frequency of the same
# character, we remove the entry from the dictionary.
# We use a sliding window of size s1 to iterate over s2 adding the newly seen right character and removing the left.
# If at some point the frequency dictionary is empty, we have a full match and can return True, if we get to the
# end of s2 without a match, we can return False.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - with n being the len(s2)
# Space complexity: O(n) - with n being the len(s1)
#
# Runtime: 61 ms, faster than 98.26% of Python3 online submissions for Permutation in String.
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 68.06% of Python3 online submissions for Permutation in String.
