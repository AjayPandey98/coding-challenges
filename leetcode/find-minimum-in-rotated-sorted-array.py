# A naive solution would iterate over all the input and return the
# minimum found.
#
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
#
# Surprisingly, this passes the tests.
# Runtime: 96 ms, faster than 5.38%
# Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 23.54%
class Naive:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return min(nums)


# If we had a sorted array, the answer would be to trivially return the
# leftmost element. Since the array is rotated, we have a point in the
# array, it could be 0, where we could split the array into two sorted
# arrays, if we find that point, the minimum will be the leftmost
# element of the right section. We can improve on the previous solution
# using binary search to find that point.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - Each iteration we eliminate half of the
# remaining elements.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only use pointers. Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 84.63%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 96.01%

            # If the entire section we are looking at is sorted, the
            # minimum is the leftmost element.
            if nums[l] < nums[r]:
                return nums[l]
            # Otherwise, look at the middle element.
            mid = (r + l) // 2
            # Mid is in the rotated portion of the array move the right
            # pointer.
            if nums[mid] < nums[l]:
                r = mid
            # Mid is in the non rotated section of the array.
            else:
                l = mid
        # If we have only two elements left, return the min.
