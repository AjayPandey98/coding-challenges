# Use two stacks, iterate over the characters in the input strings pushing and popping as required then compare the
# resulting stacks.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over all elements in the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stacks could grow to the same size as the input strings.
#
# Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 51.20% of Python3 online submissions for Backspace String Compare.
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 73.78% of Python3 online submissions for Backspace String Compare.

# once more to compare the results.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We are not using any data structures but generating values as they are used.
