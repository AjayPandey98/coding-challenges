# We can start with the brute-force method, for each position in the
# input list, iterate over all numbers in the window and add the max to
# the result set.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*k) - For each position n, we visit k positions
# trying to find the window maximum. Equivalent to O(n^2) for large k.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We keep the results in a list that will be
# size n-k which simplifies to O(n).
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize a list in O(n) to store results in O(1).
        res = [None] * (len(nums) - k + 1)

            # maximum.

# Looking at the brute-force solution above, we can see that the problem
# is that for each value of n, we visit k numbers, for large values of
# k that is O(n^2) time complexity. Since we have to visit at least once
# each value of nums, we need to focus in reducing the complexity of
# obtaining the maximum value in the sliding window. A data structure
# that can help us do that is a heap. By pushing elements that we visit
# into the heap, with O(log(n)) cost, we can fetch the biggest element
# in the heap in O(1) time. We can push the element value together with
# its position in the input array, that way we can check if the top
# element is still within the sliding window before using it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We visit each element and push-pop from
# the heap for each.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The result array size depends on the input
# size.

# We can use a monotonic queue to be able to access the max value in the
# sliding window in linear time. The monotonic queue will store a
# maximum of k elements and it guarantees that the order of the elements
# is strictly increasing from left to right.
#
# Since we are managing the monotonic queue manually, i.e. it is not a
# built-in structure like the heap of the previous solution, we can
# store element indexes in the queue and access the element in nums to
# check its value. This has the advantage that we check both value and
# position storing only one value.
