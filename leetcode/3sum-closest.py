# Sort the input, fix one element starting from the left and use
# two pointers encircling the remaining window to calculate possible
# sums. When the current sum is bigger than target, shrink the window
# from the right, when smaller, shrink it from the left, this allows us
# to find the best 3sum with each element in O(n).
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - For each element, we find the best 3sum that
# contains it in linear time.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We keep one sum and 3 pointers in memory.
#
# Runtime: 7216 ms, faster than 40.63%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 88.54%
