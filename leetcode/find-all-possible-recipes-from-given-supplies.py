# Visualize the problem as a directed graph. Store the number of each
# recipe's dependencies as the outdegree and process the available
# ingredients. For each ingredient, remove the dependency form its
# dependents.
#
# Time complexity: O(r+i) - For each node, we will visit all its
# dependencies, this maxes out at the number of edges in the dependency
# graph.
# Space complexity: O(r+i) - The number of recipes + ingredients
#
# Runtime: 1547 ms, faster than 36.02%
# Memory Usage: 17.1 MB, less than 70.55 %
