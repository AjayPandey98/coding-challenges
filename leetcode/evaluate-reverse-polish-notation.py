# We can use a stack to solve this problem.
# Iterate over the input tokens. When we find an integer, we push it
# into the stack. When we find an operand in the set (+ - / +), we pop
# the last two values from the stack in order and perform the operation
# that the operator indicates, then push the result back into the stack.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element of the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack will grow linearly in relation to
# the size of the input.
