# the number by itself n times.

# Space complexity; O(1)
#
# The test cases are probably designed to make this solution fail with
# Time Limit Exceeded, and make us find a better solution.

# Use divide-and-conquer and recursion to perform only a log(n) number
# of operations. We will recursively divide the problem into two smaller
# problems and multiply the result.
#
# i.e. (x, 5) => (x, 3) * (x, 2)
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - We divide the exponent by 2 each call.
# Space complexity; O(log(n)) - We will have log(n) recursive calls.
#
# This solution should be valid but it fails the LeetCode tests, I
# believe the problem is that the tests use an internal function and
# only round the end result, instead of rounding every intermediate
# one.
