# We can sort the characters in p alphabetically, then check all sequences of the same length in s, sort them
# and check to see if they match. But that would cost O(n*log(n)) because we need to sort each subsequence of s.
# A better method is to create a hashmap of character frequencies in the current substring, with two pointers, for
# each position, we need to subtract one character and add one in O(1) then check against the character frequencies
# on p.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - we visit each position 1.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The result set could grow to size len(s) if all positions matched. The hashmap
# will have, at most p elements, if we do not consider the output in the complexity analysis, then O(p).
