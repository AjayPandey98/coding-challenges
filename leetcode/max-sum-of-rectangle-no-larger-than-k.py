# Calculate the prefix sums of all the matrix positions, and use them to
# calculate the range sums for each possible combination of top-left and
# bottom-right.
#
# Time complexity: O((m*n)^3) - We loop through all col/row positions
# and, for each, calculate the range sum using each possible top-right
# corner value.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The sum matrix has the same size as the
# input. We could even overwrite the input matrix to have a complexity
# of O(1) but it would not really improve performance.
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.
