# Use two pointers. For each window, check if we can make all characters in the current window the same using
# the replacements allowed by k. If we can, check if we need to update the best result and move the right
# pointer, if we cannot, shrink the window by moving the left pointer.
# To check if we can make all characters in the current sliding window the same, we can use a Counter, if
# the sum of the most common character in the counter + k is equal or greater than the length of the current
# window, we can make all characters the same, if is lesser, we cannot.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each character once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The Counter is indexed by character, it has a max size of 26.

# Runtime: 305 ms, faster than 21.80% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Repeating Character Replacement.
