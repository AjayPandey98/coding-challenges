# Iterate over all matrix positions starting at the top-left and add
# each value to a list formed by all the values of the given diagonal.
# We can easily determine which positive diagonal a position belongs to
# subtracting its column index from its row index. Once we have all the
# diagonals expressed as lists, sort them, then create a result matrix
# of the same size as the input matrix and iterate over its positions
# assigning the correct value obtained from the dictionary.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n*log(min(m,n))) - We iterate over all the matrix
# positions, for each diagonal, of max length min(m,n), we sort it.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The diagonals dictionary has the same size
# as the matrices.
#
# Runtime: 91 ms, faster than 88.85%
# Memory Usage: 14.6 MB, less than 10.92%
