import timeit
from typing import Optional

from data import LinkedList, ListNode


# Two pointers a fast one moves n positions ahead of a slow one.
# When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, remove the
# node right after the slow pointer. This handles the case when n == 1.
# Handle separately the case when the node to be removed is the head.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - we visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - we only store pointers in memory.
#
# Runtime: 34 ms, faster than 94.01%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 69.55%
