# Keep two dictionaries, one with the elements that we haven't placed
# into a sequence yet, another weth the end of sequences that we have
# built already, and can append to. Iterate over the input, first
# trying to place the elements into an existing sequence, then, if not
# possible, trying to build a sequence with the element that we are
# visiting and the two next ones. If both these are not possible, we
# cannot use the current element in any sequence and we can return
# false.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once and decide where to
# place it or return false.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The counter and the dictionary will grow
# linearly with the size of the input.

# Runtime: 567 ms, faster than 91.07%
