# We need to find the largest values a>b>c such that a<b+c, since that
# is the condition for them to find a triangle.

# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The sorting step has the highest cost.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only the input and output use variable memory.

# Similar math to the previous solution but use a heap to get the next
# biggest value, this improves the time complexity on everything except
# the worst case because we will only have to reorder the heap at
# O(log(n)) k times, where k is the number of values we will check.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The worst case remains the same because
# we pop all elements from the heap at O(log(n)).
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only the input and output use variable memory.
