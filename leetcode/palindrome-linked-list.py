# The most obvious solution is to convert to array, then check if the

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node up to 3 times.

# Follow-up question where they ask to do it on O(n) time and O(1)
# space.
# Idea:
#
# - Travel through the linked list once to get its length.
# - Travel again through the list, from the head, reversing the links
# - until we are at the middle node or between the two central nodes.
# - Check the value of each node on the tail against the value of its
# - symmetrical node on the middle half, now traveling in reverse.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We travel all nodes 3 times in a palindromic
# list.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store the number of nodes and a few
# references to nodes, independently of the input size.
