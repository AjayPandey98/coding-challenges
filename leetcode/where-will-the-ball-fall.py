# Simulate the balls falling through the grid keeping an array positions, dp, of size n that records where the
# i-th ball is on the m-th move. If a ball gets stuck, update its position to -1 and ignore it on further moves.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We calculate each value of position (n) for each move of the balls (m).
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store a list of size n in memory.
#
# Runtime: 326 ms, faster than 49.46% of Python3 online submissions for Where Will the Ball Fall.
# Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 84.62% of Python3 online submissions for Where Will the Ball Fall.
