# Iterate over the dominoes checking the current value. When we find a
# "L" or "R" value, handle that portion of the string. We keep a pointer
# to the leftmost value that has been processed. When the iterator finds
# a "L" value, it will check the value under the leftmost pointer, if it
# is a "R" it will use a shrinking window to push left dominoes to the
# right and right dominoes to the left until the pushes cancel each
# other in the middle. If a neutral "." is under the left pointer, then
# all the dominoes left of the iterator get pushed to the left. Once we
# process that section, we update the left pointer. When the iterator
# finds a "R" value, it checks the element under the left pointer, if
# it finds a "R", it updates all values between the pointers to "R" and
# adjusts the left pointer. If it finds a ".", it will adjust the
# pointer without updating any values.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Any value is visited at most twice.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The input is cast to a list to work with the
# values, then parsed to string to return the expected format.

# This is a neat idea that I saw in the NeetCode YouTube channel at:
#
#
# We can look at the time, seconds they call them in the description, as
# the levels of a BFS algorithm, each second, nodes that are falling
# right or left get processed, we compute how they will affect their
# neighbors, and any neighbor that is caused to fall is added to the
# queue to be processed as part of the next level.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over all the nodes initially, to
# find which nodes we need to process. Once we start processing nodes,
# we visit each one a maximum of one time.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue that we use to process nodes, and
# the list that we use to store intermediate states, take, or can take
# up to, O(n)

# Runtime: 444 ms, faster than 68.93%
# Memory Usage: 18.4 MB, less than 53.04%
