# We can use depth first search, traverse the graph looking for the
# first character in the search word. When we find it, we call a
# function that recursively starts checking its neighbors for the next
# characters of the word. If any of the sequences matches the input,
# we return true.
#
# Time complexity: O(4^(m*n)) - O(n) For the initial matrix traversal,
# then O(4^(m*n)) if all paths matched the input like in example 4.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The number of calls in the call stack is
# limited to the size of the matrix.
#
# This solution fails with Time Limit Exceeded even though the logic is
# similar to other solutions that pass. This could be due to the extra
# CPU time needed to hash set keys and create tuple objects.
