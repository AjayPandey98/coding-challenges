# Shift all the values starting from the given node to the left by one,
# when we get to the end of the list, use a previous pointer to set the
# next reference of the one to last node to null.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We only visit nodes once from the given one
# to the end of the list.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only keep pointers.
#
# Runtime: 66 ms, faster than 60.27%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 91.10%
