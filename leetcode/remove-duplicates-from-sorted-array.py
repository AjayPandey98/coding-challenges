# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space, if we don't consider input
# and output arrays.

# This solution is modified to work in the LeetCode tests, they ask for

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 154 ms, faster than 50.33%
# Memory Usage: 15.5 MB, less than 65.27%
#
# NOTE: This solution does not work locally, it is modified to work with
# the LeetCode tests, it modifies the input in place and returns the
# number of unique elements.
