# Use binary search to find where x is, or should be if present, in the
# input array, once done, start adding elements from the ones
# surrounding that position based on the conditions given on the problem
# description.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n) + k) - We can find the insertion position
# for n in log(n) time using binary search, then we add k elements in
# linear time to the result.
# Space complexity: O(k) - The queue will grow to size k.
#
# Runtime: 331 ms, faster than 88.09%
# Memory Usage: 15.7 MB, less than 27.45%
