# The brute force approach iterates over all the elements in one array

# iterating over all the positions in both arrays.

# We can avoid recalculating the number of matched characters for each
# possible offset and position of the two input arrays by storing them
# into a matrix. Each position of the matrix records the number of
# matching characters that we have if we use its row and column as the
# indexes in the input arrays and work backwards. For example, if
# dp[3][4] = 2, that means that if we start an nums1[2] and nums2[4] and
# compare the values backwards, we will have two equal values, the next
# will not be equal. If we store this data in a matrix, when we want to
# compute the number of matches that we will have at [4][5], we only
# need to check if the values at these indexes are equal, if they are,
# we add 1 to the value found at dp[3][4].

# Time complexity: O(n*m) - Where n and m are the size of the input
# arrays. We iterate over one array, for each value, we iterate over all
# the values of the other array.
# Space complexity: O(n*m) - The matrix that stores temporary results
# has a size n*m where n and m are the size of the input arrays.
