# A brute-force approach will start by picking all numbers and, for each
# iteration, it would combine them with all the numbers again until
# we either came to a solution or the current result became bigger than
# target. Since that would result in permutations of the same values, we
# need to find another approach.
# Instead we can start picking values off the candidates array and for
# each, choose to use it [0..target // value] times. Then pass that
# decision down the decision tree.
# When we get to a result, go over the target, or we exhaust the
# candidates, we stop exploring that branch.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^t) - For each iteration, we have m possible
# choices with m being the remaining target // the current value. To
# calculate the complexity, we can also see it as a decision tree where
# for each decision, we can either take or not the current value. Since
# the value could be 1, we could take it target number of times until it
# ends up adding up to target.
# Space complexity: O(2^t) - The call stack.
#
# Runtime: 100 ms, faster than 77.71%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 72.82%
