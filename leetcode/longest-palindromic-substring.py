# We can start looking for a solution by checking if the original string is a palindrome, if it isn't, do
# a recursive call with both the left-trimmed version and the right-trimmed version. This is a brute-force
# solution in which we are checking all possible substrings of the input string.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^3)
# Space complexity: O(1)
#
# This solution will fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We still iterate over all possible substrings but only check if they are palindromes
# one time. This brings the complexity down.

# We use the fact that palindromes are simetrical around their center, iterate over single characters, and pairs of
# characters, in s, and try to build palindromes expanding out from them. When we build the longest palindrome we
# can from each start position, we check it against the longest we have seen so far.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We are expanding each palindrome around its center O(n) 2* each position in the string 2n.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We are using a constant amount of extra memory, pointers to right and left index.
