# elements after nums are smaller than it. O(n2) - it will fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

# Time complexity: O(n^2).
# Space complexity: O(1) - if we don't take into account the input and output arrays.

# Use a binary indexed tree to keep count, for each value in the input array, of how many elements equal or smaller
# we have already seen. Then start iterating from the back of the input array, for each position, update the result
# array and add the current value to the binary indexed tree.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We visit each element on the input array and, for each, update the tree O(log(n)).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The binary indexed tree is stored in memory as an array of size len(nums) + 1.
