# The maximum product for an array containing either only positive
# integers, or an even number of negative integers, would be the entire
# array. If there are an uneven number of negative values, we have to
# find the maximum product to either the right or left of one of them.
# The special cases we have to take into account are:
#
# - A zero value, we can decide to take:
#   - The subarray to the left.
#   - The subarray to the right.
#   - The zero itself.
#
# - An uneven number of negative values, have to discard:
#   - The subarray left of the first negative value including it.
#   - The subarray right of the last negative value including it.
#
# We can calculate the prefix and suffix products and take the maximum
# between them. We need to take care of resetting the current product
# to a neutral value when we find a 0.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element twice.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store three variables.

# Runtime: 148 ms, faster than 35.59%
# Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 79.17%

# We can use the same logic as in the previous solution but using extra

# Going one step further, we can make the observation that a negative
# value changes the sign of the product, if we had a negative product
# from the subarray up to this value, it would become a positive one.
# Now we see that we can iterate over the array keeping the maximum and
# minimum product that we can obtain from a subarray up to this point.
# We visit each value of the input, computing the maximum and minimum
# that we could obtain up to this point by:
#
# - The maximum is the maximum of:
#   - The product of the current value by the current maximum.
#     (handles positive values correctly)
#   - The product of the current value by the current minimum.
#     (handles negative values correctly)
#   - The value that we are visiting itself.
#     (handles correctly restarting the calculation after seeing a 0)
#
# - The minimum is the minimum of:
#   - The product of the current value by the current maximum.
#     (it would store a current maximum that was negated by the current
#      value and was converted to the maximum at a later point)
#   - The product of the current value by the current minimum.
#     (it handles small positive values)
#   - The value that we are visiting itself.
#     (handles correctly restarting the calculation after seeing a 0)
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Three variables.
