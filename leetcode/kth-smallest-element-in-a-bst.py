# The inorder traversal of a BST results in a sorted list of its node
# values, therefore, we can explore the tree inorder until we have
# seen k values, and return the value at that node.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We may visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(h) - Where h is the height of the BST. O(n) worst
# case, if the tree is very unbalanced. O(log(n)) best case, with a
# balanced tree.
