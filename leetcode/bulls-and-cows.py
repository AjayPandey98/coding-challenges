# Iterate over the length of the input strings checking if the characters match. If they match, add to the "bulls"
# if they don't match, store them in one of two dictionaries, seen in the guess or seen in the secret.
# Loop through one of the dictionaries checking which characters, and in which frequency, are also in the other
# dictionary. For each match in character, add 1 to the cow count.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over the input once, then once over the dictionary of non-matched digits.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary could grow to size n.
#
# Runtime: 71 ms, faster than 39.09% of Python3 online submissions for Bulls and Cows.
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 98.91% of Python3 online submissions for Bulls and Cows.
