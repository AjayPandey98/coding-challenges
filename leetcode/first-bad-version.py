# 278. First Bad Version
# ðŸŸ¢ Easy

# Tags: Binary Search - Interactive

# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

import timeit


def isBadVersion(val):
    return val >= 45


# Binary search with a twist, looking for the leftmost item that matches
# a given condition. The condition needs to be tested via a function call.
#
# This problem displays a good example of why it is important for software
# engineers to understand algorithms, and not be completely reliant on
# libraries. The problem can be solved using binary search, but the fact
# that we don't have an array of items, and instead need to call the API to
# check 'if the version is a bad one'
#
# Runtime: 53 ms, faster than 28.22% of Python3 online submissions for First Bad Version.
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 96.88 % of Python3 online submissions for First Bad Version.
