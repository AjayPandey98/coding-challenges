# Iterate over the characters in O(n) to find the smallest intervals
# that contain each character, then iterate over the intervals merging
# them and recording their length to return as an array.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate once over all the characters in the
# input s and then once over the intervals, the number of which equals
# the number of unique characters in the string, max 26.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The dictionary of char: interval has a max
# size of 26, the second loop uses constant space.
#
# Runtime: 60 ms, faster than 69.20%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 68.63%
