# Find the biggest horizontal and vertical slice sizes and multiply them
# to get the biggest area.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n) + m*log(m)) - Where n is the number of
# horizontal cuts and m is the number of vertical cuts. The sorting step
# has the biggest complexity, if the input was sorted, it would be O(n).
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant space.
#
# Runtime: 343 ms, faster than 91.34%
# Memory Usage: 26.7 MB, less than 94.03%
