# Similar to LeetCode 278. First Bad Version, but here we have to find the first and last occurrence of the
# given number, we can do it by running two simultaneous binary searches, one for the start and one for the end.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - We split the input by half in each iteration.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store 6 pointers in memory.
#
# Runtime: 140 ms, faster than 40.86% of Python3 online submissions for Find First and Last Position of Element in
# Sorted Array.
# Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 50.23% of Python3 online submissions for Find First and Last Position of Element
# in Sorted Array.
