from bisect import bisect_right
from collections import defaultdict


# The store will consist of a hashmap with strings as keys and arrays
# as values, since we are guaranteed to have strictly increasing
# timestamps, on set we can append the given timestamp and value to the
# given key's list, that will result in a list of values ordered by
# increasing timestamp. This sorted property lets us use binary search
# on the get method to obtain O(log(e)) time complexity, where e is the
# number of entries for the given key. This can lead to a worst time of
# O(log(n)) if all the values are under the same key.
#
# Space complexity: O(n) - With n the number of set calls, since we are
# storing all the elements given.
#
# Runtime: 797 ms, faster than 91.29%
# Memory Usage: 72.1 MB, less than 38.03%

        # the timestamp and e[1] is the value set at that timestamp.
