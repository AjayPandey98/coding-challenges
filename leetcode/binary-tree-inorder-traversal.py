# The inorder traversal first explores the left subtree, then the root,
# then the right subtree. It is easy to implement it recursively calling
# the same method on the left, then the right subtree.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack. The best case, with a well
# balanced tree, it would be O(log(n)) but the worst case, a completely
# unbalanced tree, it would be O(n).
#
# Runtime: 62 ms, faster than 13.79%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 60.15%

# For the iterative version, we use a stack. We keep a reference to a
# current node that we are traveling, but not processing yet, and keep
# traveling downwards through the left branch, pushing nodes into the
# stack, until we get to a leaf, when we do, we pop a node from the
# stack, process it, adding its value to the result, and assign its
# right child as the current node that we are traveling.
