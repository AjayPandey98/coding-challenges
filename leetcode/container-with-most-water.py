# Use a two pointer approach, start at both ends and shrink the window
# from the smaller height, keeping track of the biggest container seen.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each height once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 1098 ms, faster than 56.31%
# Memory Usage: 27.5 MB, less than 12.16%
