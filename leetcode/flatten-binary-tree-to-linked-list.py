# Use recursive DFS to flatten the tree.
# This solution should be slower than the other two but it is faster with the LeetCode tests, it could be due to the
# tests themselves.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - For the call stack.
#
# Runtime: 50 ms, faster than 68.94% of Python3 online submissions for Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List.
# Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 47.67% of Python3 online submissions for Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List.

# a stack, make the right pointer point to the left child and set the left pointer to null. If a node only has a right
# child, then process it next.
# If a children does not have either, try to pop from the stack.

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once or twice.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack could hold n/2 nodes depending on the shape of the input tree.

# What the exercise is asking for is almost a Morris traversal of the binary tree. We can make use of that fact to
# provide a solution with O(1) space complexity, no recursion and no stack.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once, the outer while loop will visit each node once, the inner while
# loop will visit each node none or one time.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only keep a pointer to the current node we are processing.
