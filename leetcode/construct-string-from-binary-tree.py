# Preorder DFS over the tree, each subtree gets wrapped recursively in
# parentheses, when a node only has a right child, we add an empty
# parentheses before it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack will grow to the height of the
# tree, which can grow to size n, for example a tree where each node
# only has one children.

# Runtime: 59 ms, faster than 86.02%
# Memory Usage: 16.6 MB, less than 5.63%
