# We can use a greedy approach because the cars cannot overtake each
# other. Start processing cars starting from the one closest to the
# target, keep track of how many time units it takes to get to the
# target, any cars that take strictly more time than the previous fleet
# to arrive at the target will create its own fleet.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the cars by position has the
# highest complexity, then we can process them in O(n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorted uses time sort with O(n), zip uses O(n)
# as well.
#
# Runtime: 922 ms, faster than 98.61%
# Memory Usage: 36.1 MB, less than 58.17%

            eta = (target - p) / s
            # If this car's eta is strictly higher than the previous car
            # that we saw, it will create its own fleet.

                fleets += 1
                last = eta

            # fleet-up.
