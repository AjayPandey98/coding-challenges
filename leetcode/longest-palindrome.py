# Iterate over the characters storing them in a dictionary as we go,
# every time we find a pair, we add 2 to the result, only once, if we
# have an uneven number of characters, we add an extra 1 for the
# character in the middle of the palindrome.
#
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n) - For the dictionary.

# Runtime: 80 ms, faster than 5.54%
