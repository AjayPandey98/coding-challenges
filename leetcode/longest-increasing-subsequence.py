# TODO add incremental solutions until we get to O(n*log(n))

# We can use an array to store partial results. On each position i, we
# will store the index of nums where we can find the last element of a
# sequence of length i. Then we iterate over all values of nums in O(n)
# and, for each, we search the dp array for the longest sequence we can
# find (the highest index of dp) that points to a value in nums that is
# smaller than the current value we are checking. Since the value is
# smaller, we know that we can build a sequence of length i + 1.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We iterate over all values in nums and,
# for each, we do a binary search on dp in O(log(n))
# Space complexity: O(n) - dp has length n + 1.
#
# Runtime: 161 ms, faster than 75.57%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 83.70%
