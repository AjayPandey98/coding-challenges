# Use a min heap to store the k elements closest to the origin. We can
# push or push and pop an element to the heap in O(log(k)).
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(k)) - Pushing n elements into the heap at
# log(k) cost each, we could improve this checking if k is greater than
# n/2, in that case we could heapify the input in O(n) then pop n-k
# elements in O(log(k)), that would improve the complexity to
# O(min(k, n-k)*log(k))
# Space complexity: O(k) - The size of the heap.
#
# Runtime: 1756 ms, faster than 31.3%
# Memory Usage: 20.4 MB, less than 61.68%
