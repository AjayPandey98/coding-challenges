# The brute force approach visits every station that can be reached with
# the current amount of fuel and, for each, decides to either refuel
# there or skip it.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^n) - With n being the number of gas stations, we
# choose to either visit or not visit each of them.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We can have n calls in the stack before they
# start returning results.
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.
# We could easily memoized visitNext using @functools.cache but it would
# not help because most of the redundant work would still be done.

# A different approach than the evolution from brute force to dynamic
# programming of the previous solutions is based on greedy.
# We can make use of the fact that we don't need to decide if we stop
# or not at a gas station as we visit. We can "drive past" all of them,
# remembering the amount of gas that they had, until we "run out of gas"
# then add the gas at the station that we passed with the most gas, the
# best way of using one stop, to the current, and keep driving.
# The best way to keep track of which gas station, out of the ones that
# we have visited and not stopped at, has the most gas is using a heap.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We visit each element and push it into
# the heap at O(log(n)), occasionally we pop from the heap to refuel.
# Even if we popped from the heap as often as we pulled the complexity
# would remain the same.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The heap can grow to the size of the input.
