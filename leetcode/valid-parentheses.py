import timeit


# Use a stack, visit each character in the string and check if it can be
# used to close the last open parentheses, the top of the stack, if it
# can, remove the matching symbol and move to the next, if it cannot,
# add it to the stack. If the string is composed of valid parentheses,
# at the end of the execution, the stack should be empty.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element and do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack could grow to the size of the input.

# Runtime: 33 ms, faster than 91.84%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 26.59%

# group of parentheses. The main logic is the same as in the previous
