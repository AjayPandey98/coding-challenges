# result of product and division operations, once we process the whole
# string, reverse the stack and start popping from it to compute sums
# and subtractions.

# Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time over the number of characters of
# the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We could store the entire input in the stack.
