# Use a min heap to store the heads of all the lists, carefully handling
# edge cases like no lists and empty lists. Use a dummy node as the head
# of the result and start appending the elements we pop from the heap
# to the result linked list, when we pop an element, if it has a next,
# we push it into the heap. Since we are popping the heads of sorted
# lists from a heap, they will be sorted in non-descending order.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*log(n)) - Where m is the combined number of
# elements in all the heaps and m is the number of lists, which will be
# the number of nodes in the heap.
# Space complexity: O(m) - The heap will have m elements.
