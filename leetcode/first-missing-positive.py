# Use the pigeon hole principle with the array positions as the holes.
# We visit each position on the array, if we find a positive integer
# that would fit a "hole", that is, one of the array positions between
# 0 and len(arr), we swap it with the value there, we keep doing this
# until the current index has a value that does not belong in any of
# the holes, or the destination hole already has its correct value, then
# we move to the next hole. Once we iterate over the entire array, we
# know that holes that have their corresponding value in the array will
# be filled with the correct value, we iterate over the array from the
# start, the index of the first hole that contains the wrong pigeon is
# the first missing positive.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Since on each operation we are placing, at
# least, one of the values in its correct pigeon hole, we will do that
# operation at most n-1 times, then we will skip these correct positions
# in the outer loop, even with the nested for-while loop on the first
# pass, the complexity remains O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 770 ms, faster than 40.67%
# Memory Usage: 27.2 MB, less than 82.84%
