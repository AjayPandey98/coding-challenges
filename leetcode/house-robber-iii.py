# The thief needs to visit each node and, for each, decide if it is
# best to rob it or not. The naive solution explores two branches from
# each node, the one that robs that node and the one that does not, at
# a time complexity of O(2^n). We can improve on that solution if we
# explore the tree using postorder DFS and, in each return to the
# parent we pass two values, the max if we had used that node, and the
# max if we had not used that node. The parent then can in turn
# compute the max loot possible using itself and not using itself. The
# solution to the problem is the max of using and not using the root.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - For the call stack.
#
# Runtime: 116 ms, faster than 9.11%
# Memory Usage: 16.2 MB, less than 39.52%
