# We can see that to solve the problem we need to find all sequences of
# the same color and, for each, eliminate all balloons except for one,
# we can use a greedy approach because we know that the most efficient
# solution will be to keep the balloon with the highest removal cost and
# keep the others. We iterate over the balloons keeping the color of the
# current sequence and the highest removal cost that we have seen in the
# current sequence in two variables, if the balloon we visit has the
# same color of the current sequence, we know that we need to remove
# either this balloon or the previous one we decided to keep, we
# choose to remove the one with the smaller cost and add that cost to
# the result. When we get to a balloon with a different color, we
# temporarily decide to keep it and store that color as the current
# sequence color and its cost as the highest cost.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once and perform O(1)
# tasks.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store three variables. Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 1040 ms, faster than 98.87%
# Memory Usage: 25 MB, less than 52.92%
