# Use a Counter to find element doubles in O(1), iterate over the input
# in O(n) checking if we have used them already, they were some other
# element's double, or if they have a double.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The sorting step has the highest cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The counter and the result.

# Runtime: 3863 ms, faster than 5.13%

        # There are several ways to check if the array is doubled after
        # processing all the values, for example, the length of res has
        # to be exactly half of the length of changed, but we can also
        # check that we have used up all elements.

# The previous solution does unnecessary work when we have many repeated
# values in the array, we can optimize if we sort the counter and check
# validity against the counts instead of iterating over the repeated
# values one by one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n+k*log(k)) - Where n is the number of values in
# the input and k is the number of unique values in the input.
# Space complexity: O(k) - The counter can only grow to size k. If we
# take into account the result array, it would be O(n). k could be == n.
