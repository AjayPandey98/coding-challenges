# Define a helper function that lets us visualize the remaining section on the matrix in the debugger.
#
# Paste `viewRemaining(matrix, top, right, bottom, left)` into the watch section of the debugger and it will
# display the current remaining rows and columns that the algorithm needs to explore.
#
# It is designed to work with the `Boundaries` solution

# Keep track of the boundaries of the matrix area that we haven't explored yet and keep updating them as we visit
# rows and columns adding their values to the result.
# This solution is easier to understand, we can visualize it as "eliminating" each row and column from the matrix
# once we visit them.
# The process can be visualized using the helper function viewRemaining()
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element in the matrix.
# Space complexity: O(1) - If we don't take into account the output list.
