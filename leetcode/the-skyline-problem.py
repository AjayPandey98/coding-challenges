# Iterate over the input buildings using a heap to store buildings that
# could affect the skyline sorted by height descending. Before adding
# the current building to the heap, pop any buildings which right ends
# are further left than the left side of the current building from the
# heap, checking how going past them would affect the skyline. Then push
# the current building into the heap and check if it would modify the
# current maximum height.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We iterate over the buildings in O(n),
# but the main complexity comes from pushing and popping all of them
# in and out of the heap at O(log(n)) each.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The heap can grow to the same size as the
# input.
#
# Runtime: 180 ms, faster than 74.68%
# Memory Usage: 18.8 MB, less than 95.50%
