# Looking at the description, it seems like the best complexity we can
# try to achieve is O(n) since we will need to visit at least once, each
# character of the input.
# One observation that helps us, is that the length of the input words
# is restricted and, while there could be a high number of words, they
# are pretty short.
#
# 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104
# 1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
#
# We can take all the subsequences in words2 and build a dictionary of
# frequencies needed to be a universal word. Then check all words in
# word1 against that dictionary.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each character in the input a
# constant number of times.
# Space complexity: O(1) - If we don't consider the input and output
# lists, we are only keeping the frequencies dictionary in memory, it
# has a max length of 10.
#
# Runtime: 1712 ms, faster than 26.01% of Python3 online submissions for
# Word Subsets.
# Memory Usage: 18.5 MB, less than 87.67% of Python3 online submissions
# for Word Subsets.
