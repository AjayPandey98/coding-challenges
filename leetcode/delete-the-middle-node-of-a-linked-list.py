# Use the fast&slow pointers technique to find the middle node, since we
# are interested in deleting it, we initialize the slow pointer to one
# position before the head, that way, when fast finds the end of the
# list, we can delete the node right after slow. To make the code easier
# to read, we can call the slow pointer "pre".
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node at most once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only keep two extra pointers in memory.
#
# Runtime: 1883 ms, faster than 92.20%
# Memory Usage: 60 MB, less than 94.23%

        # easier, another option would be to first find the middle node,
        # then iterate over the list to delete it.
