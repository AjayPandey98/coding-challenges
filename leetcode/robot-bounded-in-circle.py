import timeit


# Simulate the robot movements, at the end of each set of instructions,
# check if the distance keeps increasing. We only have four directions
# of movement that are possible, after each set of iterations, check if
# the robot is back at the origin, if it is, it is bounded, if after 4
# sets of instructions the robot is not back at the origin, it is not
# bounded by a circle. The explanation is that, if we look at the vector
# formed by executing all the instructions, the consecutive vectors
# formed by successive executions can only have an angle of 0, 90 or 180
# degrees with each other.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of instructions, we
# execute at most 4 times all the instructions.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 92.50%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 21.81%

# A quicker way to arrive at the same result is to run the instructions
# one time and check if the robot has either gone back to the origin or
# it is facing in a different direction. If the robot is facing in a
# different direction, the next vector will start at that angle, 90, 180
# or 270 degrees from the original, and it will eventually go back to
# the origin.
