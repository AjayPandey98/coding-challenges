import timeit


# We can reduce time complexity using a hash map that stores the indices
# keyed by the character. We iterate over the input checking if we have
# seen the same character before, instead of keeping the longest
# sequence seen as a substring, we only keep a reference to the current
# longest sequence start index. If we see a character that we have
# already seen, meaning that it is in the currently longest sequence, we
# update our sequence by moving the start index to the position right
# after the index of the leftmost duplicate character. We check the
# length of the current sequence using the start and current character
# indices.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over the input and, for each
# character, do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary can grow to the size of the
# input.
#
# Runtime: 59 ms, faster than 96.52%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 93.13%
