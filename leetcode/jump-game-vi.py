# We can visit each element of nums, for each, calculate the best way to
# reach it from the k elements from which we can jump to this one. To
# avoid having to visit the k elements in each iteration, we can use a
# sliding window to record the best value of the possible ones, on each
# step, we add the value under the right pointer to the pool and remove
# the value under the left pointer.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We visit each element and, for each,
# push into the heap at O(log(n)). We have no guarantee that the heap
# will stay under size k, it would only if the max element was coming
# out of the sliding window. If the max element gets replaced as the
# top of the heap, it will stay in. The heap could grow to size n.
# Space complexity; O(n) - Same as before, the heap could grow to the
# same size as the input list.
