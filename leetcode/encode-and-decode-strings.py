# We can start each string by a series of digits denoting its length
# followed by a delimiter followed by the word itself. To decode, we
# start by finding the length of the next word, by reading all the
# digits found before we hit the delimiter, then processing the word,
# then moving to the next word.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Both encode and decode need to read each
# character of the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - At worst we will double the number of
# characters in the input when we encode.
#
# Runtime: 591 ms, faster than 57.00%
# Memory Usage: 6.12 MB, less than 53.79%
