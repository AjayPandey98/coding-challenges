import timeit
from math import ceil, log


# We have minutesToTest // minutesToDie iterations, for each iteration
# we can split the buckets into pigs + 1, for example, if we only can
# test once and have 10 buckets, we can use 9 pigs, give each a bucket,
# if one of them dies, we know which bucket has the poison, if none of
# them do, the bucket we didn't use has the poison. We can use the same
# reasoning for a pile of buckets.
# We are then trying to find a number x such that, for each iteration
# available to us, we can divide the number of buckets by x + 1 and, at
# the end, we have a result <= 1
# The problem hints already give us a solution: x such that (T+1)^x >= N
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - It only computes two divisions and a log.
# Space complexity: O(1) - No extra space is used.
#
# Runtime: 56 ms, faster than 22.63%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 74.45%

        # Calculate the result.
        return ceil(log(buckets, minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1))


# We can also find an iterative solution. The principle is the same as
# the above solution, we iterate over x values until x satisfies
# (T+1)^x >= N, then we return x.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - Each iteration we check buckets against
# the power of x.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space.

# Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 81.75%

        iterations = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1
        while iterations**x < buckets:

        return x


# We can improve the iterative solution if instead of calculating
# iterations**x at every step, we remember the previous value
# iterations^x-1 and we multiply once more by iterations.
# It should be possible to optimize even further if we obtained the
# most significant bit of iterations and used bit shifting with
# multiplication by a smaller number in each iteration.
