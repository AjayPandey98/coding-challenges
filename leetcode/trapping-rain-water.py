# If we get to the realization that the maximum height collected between
# two values will be determined by the lower of the two heights,
# independently of the value of the higher one, we can come up with a
# greedy O(n) solution to this problem. We use both a pointer and a
# max_height variable from each end. At each step, we update the pointer
# that is on the side of the lower of the two max heights, that
# guarantees that we know the amount of water that can be held at that
# particular point. If the inner heights from that point are smaller,
# then the two current max will determine the height of the water, if
# we find a taller height, then, we still know that the max at the
# current position is equal to the closer maximum because that one would
# be one of the extremities of this "tank" and would mark the water
# height independent of how much taller the other side is.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each position of the list once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use 5 variables independently of the size
# of the input.
#
# Runtime: 120 ms, faster than 97.96%
# Memory Usage: 16 MB, less than 81.24%
