# We can find out the frequency of each unique value in the candidates
# array. For each value, we find the range
# [0..min(target // value, value_frequency)]
# And for each of the possible choices, we explore each branch that it
# would generate.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^t) - At each level of the decision tree, we can
# choose to use or not every value and the decision tree can have height
# t, for example if one of the solutions is all 1s.
# Space complexity: O(2^t) - The call stack, same reasoning as the time
# complexity.
#
# Runtime: 96 ms, faster than 67.30%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 5.59%
