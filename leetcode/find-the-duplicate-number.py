# Use an integer as a bit mask of len(nums) bits, iterate over the input
# using the integers as indexes in the mask, for each, set its bit to 1
# when we find a bit that is already set, we have our duplicate number.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each number once and perform O(1)
# operations.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store one integer in memory. The
# maximum size of the integer is ~12KB, this solution only works in
# Python because of the unlimited size of integers. In other languages,
# we could use several integers.
#
# Runtime: 1587 ms, faster than 19.73%
# Memory Usage: 27.9 MB, less than 91.11%

# This problem can also be solved using Floyd's cycle detection
# algorithm, there is a very good explanation on the problem's official
# solution, point 7. We run Floyd's algorithm to find the point were the
# tortoise and hare meet, at that point, we slow down the hare to the
# same speed as the tortoise and move the tortoise back to the start,
# when we move them forward again, the point at which meet will be the
# first node in the cycle.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - The tortoise will visit a maximum of 2n nodes.
# Space complexity; O(1) - Two pointers stored.

# Runtime: 665 ms, faster than 92.16%
# Memory Usage: 27.9 MB, less than 57.85%

        # first node in the cycle and the tortoise and the first node

        # will be that node.
