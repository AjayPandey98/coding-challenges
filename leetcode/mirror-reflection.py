# There is an interesting bit manipulation evolution of the math
# solution here:
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/discuss/141773/C%2B%2BJavaPython-1-line-without-using-any-package-or
#
# Time complexity; O(1)? - bit manipulation and comparisons.
# Space complexity: O(1)
#
# Runtime: 34 ms, faster than 90.10%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 63.37%
#
# What the code in this solution is doing is getting the last bit that
# is set (1) on both p and q using (p & -p) and (q & - q), then
# comparing the results.
#
# (p & -p) gives the highest power of 2 by which p is evenly divisible.
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/15395424/2557030
#
# This is equivalent to dividing by 2 until one, or both, of the results
# is not even. When we divide by 2 we shift bits to the right, in this
# case until the least significant bit is 1 and we have an uneven
# number. With the bit-compare solution, we use the (p & -p) trick to
# get a value comprised only of the least significant not-zero bit of
# both numbers, if both are the same, they would have been both uneven
# after the loop, otherwise we check which one would have become uneven
# sooner, the one that results in the smaller least significant non-zero
# bit.
#
# (p & -p) >= (q & -q)
# will be true if p would yield an uneven number sooner, or at the same
# time as q
#
# (p & -p) > (q & -q)
# will be true if p would yield an uneven number sooner than q
#
# If q would yield uneven before p:
# False + False => 0
#
# If p and q would yield uneven numbers at the same time:
# True + False => 1
#
# If p would yield an uneven number earlier than q:
# True + True => 2
#
