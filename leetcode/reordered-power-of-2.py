import timeit

# Have a dictionary of all powers of 2 smaller than 10^9 keyed by the
# number of digits that they have. Get all possible candidate powers of
# two getting the number of digits of the input. Count the different
# digit frequencies on both the input and each of the candidates, if any
# of them has the same frequency of the different digits, the input
# could be a reordering of that power of two, if the input does not have
# the same character frequency as any of the candidates, it cannot be a
# reordering of a power of two.
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - We are, in the worst case counting 9 digits
# once and a different 9 digits a max of 4 times.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 73.80%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 64.17%
