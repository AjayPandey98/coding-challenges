# A first, brute-force, approach to solving the problem would be to
# simulate the CPU executing the tasks and count how many units of time
# are used up.
#
# Time complexity: O(n+log(27)) => O(n) - For each element m in the
# input, we pop from the heap in O(log(27)) => O(1) and add/remove from
# the pending dictionary in O(1), the max complexity comes from
# reordering the heap but it is still O(1) because the input can have
# a max of 27 unique tasks, the capital letters of the English
# alphabet, hence the heap can only grow to size 27.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The heap and dictionary both can grow to
# size k where k is the number of unique tasks in the input. Since the
# unique tasks number is limited by the number of capital letters in the
# English alphabet, 27, therefore O(1).
