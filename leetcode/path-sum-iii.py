# Travel through the tree using DFS, for each node that we visit, add
# its value to the current running sum and save it in a dictionary.
# We check if we can subtract any of the previous sums to the current
# sum to get the target sum. If we can, we add the number of times that
# we have seen that sum to the results, because the path between the
# current node and the nodes at which we had that sum will give the
# target sum.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack will grow proportionally to
# the size of the input.
#
# Runtime: 61 ms, faster than 88.31%
# Memory Usage: 15.3 MB, less than 55.74%
