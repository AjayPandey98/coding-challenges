# Iterate over the input keeping track of the lowest single digit and
# the lowest subsequence of two digits seen, if we see a value greater
# than the second digit in the sequence, we can return true. If we see
# a value lesser than the best single digit, we can update it, if we
# see a value greater than it but smaller than the second digit in the
# best sequence of two, we can use it, and the smallest digit, to update
# the best sequence.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each number in the input once and
# perform O(1) operations.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We keep two values in memory, an int and a
# tuple of two ints. Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 881 ms, faster than 66.1%
# Memory Usage: 24.6 MB, less than 80.42%
