# We can determine where the values we are seeking will be from the
# value of any node that is the root of the tree we are currently
# inspecting:
#
# - If both values are greater than the value of the current node,
#   both values will be located in the right subtree.
# - If both values are smaller than the value of the current node, both
#   values will be located in the left subtree.
# - If the current root's value is equal to one of the values we are
#   looking for, the other one will be a child and we have found the LCA.
# - If the current root's value is between the values of the nodes we
#   are searching, one is on the left subtree, and one is on the right
#   subtree, the current root is also the LCA.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - in each iteration, we either find the
# result or discard half of the remaining nodes.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only need to keep a pointer to the node we
# are currently visiting.
#
# Runtime: 84 ms, faster than 91.10%
# Memory Usage: 18.7 MB, less than 97.27%

# Similar idea to the above but shorter code. The longer version is more
# readable and, in my opinion, should be preferred, but this one
# displays a couple of nice tricks, using the multiplication to compare
# three values a < b < c, and using a > comparison to decide which
# branch to discard, and which one to visit, depending on the relation
# between the current root and the values searched.
