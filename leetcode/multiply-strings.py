# Looking at the solution in LeetCode, it turns out that the description wasn't very clear, it is OK to use int() to
# convert one string digit to int at a time, what they expected you to do is to not use the multiplication operator,
# that would lead to overflow, in some languages though not Python, if we could not use a big integer library.
#
# With that in mind, we can correct the solution above to not use the multiplication operator and, instead, simulate
# the multiplication process. Since we already have a dictionary that helps us convert digits to int, we can use that
# and avoid calling int().
#
# Time complexity: O(len(num1) + len(num2)) - We multiply each number in n * each one in m.
# Space complexity: O(len(num1) + O(len(num2))) - The product array is of size n + m.
