# A very simple way is to keep generating powers of 4 until we have a
# value that either matches or is greater than n.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - Each time we multiply by 4.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 30 ms, faster than 96.09%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 54.38%

        # n is an integer.

        # While the power is <= than the input.
        while p <= n:
            # If the power equals the input, return True.
            if p == n:
                return True
            # Find the next power of 4.

        # the input is not a power of 4.
        return False


# A power of 4 converted to binary will be a single 1 followed by an
# even number of 0s, could be 0 0s. Check if the input matches.
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - Only comparison and bit manipulation.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.

# Runtime: 55 ms, faster than 41.22%

        # - The only 1 is in an even position by doing binary and with
        #   a value that in binary is 1010101010101... 32 bits long
        return n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0 and n & 1431655765 == n


# We can also use the built-in log function and check if the result is
# an integer.

# Time complexity: O(1) - Not sure how log is implemented but probably
# O(1)
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
